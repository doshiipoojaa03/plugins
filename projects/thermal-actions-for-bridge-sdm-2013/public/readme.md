# Temperature Load Calculator for bridges (HK)

This plug-in calculates thermal actions on bridge structures based on Section 3.5 **Temperature Effects** from the **STRUCTURES DESIGN MANUAL for Highways and Railways 2013 Edition (SDM 2013)**, published by the Hong Kong Highways Department.

## Details

### Version: 1.0.0

- **Reference**: SDM 2013, Chapter 3.5 "Temperature Effects"
- **Issue Date**: Updated to include SDM 2013 revisions, effective as of 2023.

The plug-in estimates thermal actions on the bridge superstructure by considering both uniform temperature changes and temperature differences within the structure.

### Functionality

- **Uniform Temperature Components**: Calculates uniform temperature changes that govern the bridgeâ€™s movement. The uniform temperature is based on weighted averages of temperatures measured at various levels.
- **Temperature Difference Components**: Accounts for temperature variations between the top surface and other levels of the superstructure.
- Integrates thermal actions directly into the structural analysis.

### Important Considerations

- Ensure accurate temperature data (uniform and differential) for precise calculations.
- Compliant with SDM 2013 standards; future updates to the manual may require recalibration of the tool.
