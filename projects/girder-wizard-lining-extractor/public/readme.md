# Girder Wizard Lining Extractor

- This tool extracts alignment information using the Civil Girder Wizard.

## Details

### Version 1.0.0

- Initially, the goal was to operate the Civil Girder Wizard through an API...
- But, since the API is not supported, that idea had to be abandoned.
- Thus, the Girder Wizard must be operated manually until the model is created.
- Once the model is generated, the tool extracts alignment data based on the model's elements and node information.
- Finally, the extracted alignment data is saved as a CSV file.
