**Benefits of this plugin**
------

In design practice, it's often necessary to consider changing the diameter of rebar to a different size.

When this happens, the spacing dictated by the existing rebar diameter must also change according to the new diameter, simplifying the redesign process if it is recalculated based on the rebar area.

- Quickly verify rebar spacing according to standards, enhancing design and construction efficiency.
- Supports a rebar database to check spacing according to standards.

**How to use this plugin?**
------
1. Select the **national rebar standard**.
2. Choose the **input method** from a radio list.
3. Select the **rebar size** and **spacing**.
