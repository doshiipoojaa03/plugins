# Lumped Hinge Checker 

**Intro**
------

The Lumped Hinge Checker plugin reviews the Inelastic Hinge properties data assigned during nonlinear analysis to detect any incorrect data.
It helps identify problems before analysis to ensure accurate analysis results.

- Reviews assigned Inelastic Hinge properties data during nonlinear analysis.
- Identifies incorrectly entered yield strength values.

**Version**
------
__v1.0.0__: Plugin release

**Language**

__English__

**Benefits of this plugin**
------
- Detects incorrect hinge properties before analysis to prevent problems.
- Reduces divergence issues during analysis and ensures more accurate results.
- Reviews a large volume of hinge properties efficiently, saving time and effort.

**How to use this plugin?**
------
1. Import Inelastic Hinge Properties data.
2. Yield Strength Review:
  - Review the imported data based on a yield strength value of 0.01.
  - If incorrect yield strength values(the yield strength value is less than 0.01) are found, the user is notified(**CHECK**).

**Conclusion**
------
This guide helps you use the Lumped Hinge Checker plugin to efficiently review the Inelastic Hinge properties data assigned during nonlinear analysis, detect incorrect data beforehand, and enhance the accuracy of the analysis.
