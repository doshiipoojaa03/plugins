# Mirror Tapered Section

- This tool generates a mirrored section by swapping the I-end and J-end of a Tapered Section.

## Details

### Version 1.0.0

- It retrieves a list of Tapered Sections (non-tapered sections will not be included).
- The "New Section Name Tag" is used to define the Name Tag for the newly created mirrored section.
- For example, if the original section name is "Section 1" and the Name Tag is "\_Mirror," the new section name will be "Section 1_Mirror."

### version 1.1.0

- We have updated and improved the internal libraries, enhancing performance and stability.
