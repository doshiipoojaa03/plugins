- This plug-in automatically calculates the self-weight of the structure based on the Midas Civil NX model
- This plug-in considers various resistance conditions against buoyancy
  <br />

## Details

### version 1.0.0

- When the plugin is launched, it automatically loads from the CIVIL NX model by default.
- The 'Add Stage Set' button allows users to define custom conditions for the structure (e.g., buoyancy check during construction).
- Users can select the resistance conditions for buoyancy.
- Soil properties and additional loads can be defined by clicking the 'INPUT DETAILS' button.
- The buoyancy check is performed by defining the allowable safety factor according to the relevant standards.

### version 1.1.0

- We have updated and improved the internal libraries, enhancing performance and stability.
