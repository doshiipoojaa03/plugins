# Tunnel Lining Model Generation

This feature generates a structural analysis model for tunnel lining based on the imported DXF file, which contains the extracted centerline of the lining.

## Details

### Version 1.0.0

- The model is generated following the tunnel lining design criteria presented in the **"Concrete Lining Detailed Design Guidelines (Korea Expressway Corporation, 2016)"**.
- The user inputs the ground elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio to calculate the ground reaction coefficient.
- The end boundary conditions can be selected as either "hinge" or "spring."

### version 1.1.0

- We have updated and improved the internal libraries, enhancing performance and stability.
